# Tests and exercises
Here you can find a series of projects partly developed, partly containing only the specifications, partly complete but not working.
Fork this repository, set it as a private repository, define meaningful branches to organize your activity and work on it.
When you feel you want to share the results make a merge request.
It is not necessary to publish your results in bulk, you can also commit portions of code and push multiple times
